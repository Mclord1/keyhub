API Submissions and Listing


Overview
The API submission and listing process enables providers to offer their APIs to users. It includes a submission form where providers enter essential details about their APIs.


Workflow
Providers submit APIs, which are initially marked as "in review."
Administrators are notified via email for new API submissions.
Upon approval, the API status is updated to "live," and the data is copied to the API listings table.
Approved APIs appear on the home page for users to access.


Submission HTML Form
The submission form includes the following fields:
API Name
Short Description
Documentation URL
Long Description
Logo URL
Pricing Plans URL
Response Example

User Sign Up
Registration Process


The user sign-up process has been streamlined. Users are required to provide:
Full Name
Email
Password
Country




Password Toggle Feature
A new feature allows users to toggle password visibility on or off before submitting the form. 

A new block of code was added to support this feature.



 function togglePasswordVisibility() {
 	if (passwordInput.type === "password") {
 	passwordInput.type = "text"; // Show the password
 	slashed_eye_icon.style.display = 'block'
 	eye_icon.style.display = 'none'
 } else {
 	passwordInput.type = "password"; // Hide the password
 	slashed_eye_icon.style.display = 'none'
 	eye_icon.style.display = 'block'
 }
}










Navigation Bar


UI Modifications
The navigation bar has undergone UI updates per request. It now includes options for:

STYLING:
Updated the css styling accommodate the changes requested which includes the font-size, color and placeholder
 1. Login,
 2. sign up
 3. Documentation
 4. Adding APIs.

















Home Page


API Rendering
The home page displays both prompt api APIs and provider-created APIs. Users can click on provider-created APIs to view more details, including the product page.


Product Page
In the product page for provider-created APIs, Documentation and Pricing plans are accessible through links supplied during submission by the provider as opposed to viewable tabs on default apis product page.




















Login-Zero State Page
Different redirect scenarios on a userâ€™s login event was implemented as listed below
User Redirect Scenarios :
Scenario 1: Users creating a profile for the first time are directed to the Portal homepage, where they can explore the marketplace or add their API (Zero State Page).
Scenario 2: Users with previous marketplace API subscriptions are redirected to the subscriptions section of the dashboard.
Scenario 3: Users with their own APIs onboarded to the marketplace are directed to the API list section in the dashboard.
Scenario 4: Users with marketplace API subscriptions and their own APIs onboarded are redirected to a customized dashboard section based on their preferences.


Product Page
The product page was initially generated using description_v2.html. However, a new description_v3.html file was introduced to display provider-created APIs. Both templates share a striking resemblance in terms of rendering content to end users, but they operate with distinct data objects. Presently, description_v2.html is employed for rendering the default API product page, while description_v3.html is utilized for provider-created APIs. A notable contrast in the user interface between the two templates is outlined below:

Fig 6.1: Default API on product page


Fig 6.1: Provider-created API on product page


When comparing Figure 6.1 to Figure 6.2, we observe that the pricing and documentation tabs in Figure 6.1 have been transformed into links in Figure 6.2. Figure 6.2 provides information about an API developed by a provider, and these links direct users to the web pages provided by the provider during API submission.



STYLESHEET

A custom.css file was added on project to house custom styles on elements used on the prompt-web which can me found in:
